## Assignment 5

To submit your code:

```
./package.sh
# Then, upload submit.tar.gz to ETL
```

### 1. propinteq.cpp

Write a pass that optimizes a program by propagating equality of integer values.
To be specific, whenever `icmp eq iN x, y` is used by a branch condition, please
replace x with y (or y with x) for all uses of x that are
(1) executed after the branch is taken
(2) dominated by the conditional branch.

```
ENTRY:
  %cond = icmp eq i32 %x, %y
  br i1 %cond, label %BB_true, label %BB_false
BB_true:
  call void @f(i32 %x, i32 %y) // becomes @f(i32 %x, i32 %x)
  br label %BB_end
BB_false:
  call void @f(i32 %x, i32 %y) // shouldn't be optimized
  br label %BB_end
BB_end:
  call void @f(i32 %x, i32 %y) // shouldn't be optimized
```

The `icmp` instruction used by `br` will be in the `br`'s basic block.
For example, `%cond` above is always located in `ENTRY` block.

To check your implementation, please use `run-propinteq.sh`.
This will run 11 FileChecks in `data` directory.
Note that they are not full tests; more tests can be added by TA when grading
your homework.

```
./run-propinteq.sh all <llvm-dir>/bin
# To build propinteq.cpp..
./run-propinteq.sh build <llvm-dir>/bin
# To see the output of input.ll..
./run-propinteq.sh run <llvm-dir>/bin
# To run tests..
./run-propinteq.sh test <llvm-dir>/bin
```

#### Correctness of Optimization

Here is the list of conditions for correct replacement of two values.

1. If two instructions %x and %y are compared, and %x dominates %y,
replace %y with %x.

```
; pseudocode
entry:
  %x = ...
  br %BB1
BB1:
  %y = ...
  %cond = icmp eq i32 %x, %y
  br %cond, %BB_true, %BB_false
BB_true:
  %a = add i32 %x, %y // should be %a = add %x, %x
```

2. If two arguments %x and %y are compared, replace the one which appeared later
in the function argument list with the other one which appeared earlier.

```
define void @f(i32 %y, i32 %x) {
  %cond = icmp eq i32 %x, %y
  br %cond, %BB_true, %BB_false
BB_true:
  %a = add i32 %x, %y // should be %a = add %y, %y because the function
                      // signature is f(y, x)
}
```

3. If an argument is compared with an instruction, replace the instruction
with an argument.

```
define void @f(i32 %a) {
  %b = ...
  %cond = icmp eq i32 %a, %b
  br %cond, %BB_true, %BB_false
BB_true:
  %a = add i32 %a, %b // should be %a = add %a, %a
```

After your optimization is run, there should be no more replacable values.
It is guaranteed that a comparison with constant value is never given to a
branch condition.

#### Hints

`printdom.cpp` shows how to check dominance relation between two basic blocks
as well as an edge and a block.

### 2. Writing FileCheck Tests

Please write your own 3 FileCheck tests at mycheck/checkN.ll .

Your FileCheck tests will be run on other students' submissions, and will be
scored by measuring its effectiveness.
We'll calculate the total score based on two standards:

1. Is your FileCheck test valid?

2. How many times does it catch other students' miscompilations?

Your tests should pass your submission and our TA's solution.
Also, your pass's output should pass Alive2.

To see more details about FileCheck syntax, please visit
https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html .


#### Constraints

The test files should satisfy following constraints:

1. They are valid IR functions satisfying SSA. There is one function per file.

2. A branch condition should be either a constant or register.
If the condition is a register, it should only compare
integer registers (no vectors, pointers, int constants, etc).
If branch condition is a constant, it shouldn't be constant expression.

```
  br i1 true, ..      // okay

  %cond = icmp eq %x, %y
  br i1 %cond, ..     // okay

  %cond2 = icmp eq %x, 1
  br i1 %cond2, ..    // not okay
```

3. A terminator instruction should be either `br` or `ret`.

4. They should not have unreachable blocks.

5. If an `icmp` instruction is used by a conditional branch `br`, the conditional
branch and the `icmp` should be in the same basic block.

```
BB:
  %cond = icmp eq %x, %y
  br label %BB2
BB2:
  br i1 %cond, ..    // not okay

BB3:
  %cond3 = icmp eq %x, %y
  br li1 %cond3, ..  // okay
```

Note that all checks that are going to be used to grade your program will
satisfy these constraints.

#### Hints

You can automatize FileCheck test generation using
`<llvm source dir>/llvm/utils/update_test_checks.py`. If you're interested in
this, see FileCheck tests in `<llvm source dir>/llvm/test/`
and see how they're used!
